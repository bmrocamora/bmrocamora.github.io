Abstract:
This paper presents a solution to the motion planning problem for an autonomous airship under super-rotation winds of the Venusian atmosphere. The airship uses both buoyancy and aerodynamic lift to control its altitude. In addition, solar panels distributed over the aircraft provide energy to the propellers and allow for battery recharging. Our approach uses a sampling-based planner that relies on Dubinsâ€™ Airplane paths deformed under the influence of the winds to create a tree of kinematically feasible trajectories. We use the battery state to prune energetically unfeasible trajectories and we propose a cost function that accounts for the energy expenditure of the propulsive system and that considers battery charging by using the Economics notion of opportunity cost. The method is illustrated through a series of simulations that show how the vehicle takes longer and high-altitude paths to minimize the use of energy and favor battery recharge. Our results also show that naive trajectories are not feasible in terms of energy, justifying the need for more efficient solutions.
