The Space Robotics Challenge Phase 2 (SRC2) is a two year NASA Centennial Challenge in which teams compete to solve challenging problems that are posed by NASA. SRC2 challenges teams to develop technologies to enable lunar rovers to have increased levels of autonomy when performing tasks such as resource localization and retrieval. During the qualification rounds, teams are competing in three rounds to perform: resource localization, resource collection and autonomous self-localization. After the first year, twenty-five qualifying teams will be awarded prize money of up to $15,000 to continue. A year later, a competition round will be held in which teams compete for a first place prize of $185,000.
