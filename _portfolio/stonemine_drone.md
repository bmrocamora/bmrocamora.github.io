This cooperative robotic system currently in development comprises two major components: a rover (ground robot) and a drone (aerial robot). 
This system comprises a self-leveling landing platform on the rover-side so that the drone can take off and land on a leveled surface, even if the rover is located on a slope. 
A tether system that deliveries power to the drone from batteries located in the rover is also under development.
Ongoing research has been made in order to use the tether for drone localization by using tether variables such as angles at both endpoints (drone and rover), tension, and length. 
It is expected to use such information not only for localization purposes but also for identifying the tether states and landings. 
A fully instrumented landing platform and sensors have just been prototyped and built, then real experiments are currently being planned and executed so that new ideas, developments, and solutions can arise from this project.
